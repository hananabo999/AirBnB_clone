AirBnB clone - The console

Requirements
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)

TASKS
0. README, AUTHORS

1. Be pycodestyle compliant!
  Write beautiful code that passes the pycodestyle checks.

2. Unittests
  All your files, classes, functions must be tested with unit tests

3. BaseModel
  Write a class BaseModel that defines all common attributes/methods for other classes:

models/base_model.py
Public instance attributes:
id: string - assign with an uuid when an instance is created:
you can use uuid.uuid4() to generate unique id but don’t forget to convert to a string
the goal is to have unique id for each BaseModel
created_at: datetime - assign with the current datetime when an instance is created
updated_at: datetime - assign with the current datetime when an instance is created and it will be updated every time you change your object
__str__: should print: [<class name>] (<self.id>) <self.__dict__>
Public instance methods:
save(self): updates the public instance attribute updated_at with the current datetime
to_dict(self): returns a dictionary containing all keys/values of __dict__ of the instance:
by using self.__dict__, only instance attributes set will be returned
a key __class__ must be added to this dictionary with the class name of the object
created_at and updated_at must be converted to string object in ISO format:
format: %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f (ex: 2017-06-14T22:31:03.285259)
you can use isoformat() of datetime object
This method will be the first piece of the serialization/deserialization process: create a dictionary representation with “simple object type” of our BaseModel

4. Create BaseModel from dictionary
  Previously we created a method to generate a dictionary representation of an instance (method to_dict()).

Now it’s time to re-create an instance with this dictionary representation.

5. Store first object
  Now we can recreate a BaseModel from another one by using a dictionary representation
It’s great but it’s still not persistent: every time you launch the program, you don’t restore all objects created before… The first way you will see here is to save these objects to a file.

Writing the dictionary representation to a file won’t be relevant:

Python doesn’t know how to convert a string to a dictionary (easily)
It’s not human readable
Using this file with another program in Python or other language will be hard.

6. Console 0.0.1
  Write a program called console.py that contains the entry point of the command interpreter:

You must use the module cmd
Your class definition must be: class HBNBCommand(cmd.Cmd):
Your command interpreter should implement:
quit and EOF to exit the program
help (this action is provided by default by cmd but you should keep it updated and documented as you work through tasks)
a custom prompt: (hbnb)
an empty line + ENTER shouldn’t execute anything
Your code should not be executed when imported

7. Console 0.1
  Update your command interpreter (console.py) to have these commands:

create: Creates a new instance of BaseModel, saves it (to the JSON file) and prints the id. Ex: $ create BaseModel
If the class name is missing, print ** class name missing ** (ex: $ create)
If the class name doesn’t exist, print ** class doesn't exist ** (ex: $ create MyModel)
show: Prints the string representation of an instance based on the class name and id. Ex: $ show BaseModel 1234-1234-1234.
If the class name is missing, print ** class name missing ** (ex: $ show)
If the class name doesn’t exist, print ** class doesn't exist ** (ex: $ show MyModel)
If the id is missing, print ** instance id missing ** (ex: $ show BaseModel)
If the instance of the class name doesn’t exist for the id, print ** no instance found ** (ex: $ show BaseModel 121212)
destroy: Deletes an instance based on the class name and id (save the change into the JSON file). Ex: $ destroy BaseModel 1234-1234-1234.
If the class name is missing, print ** class name missing ** (ex: $ destroy)
If the class name doesn’t exist, print ** class doesn't exist ** (ex:$ destroy MyModel)
If the id is missing, print ** instance id missing ** (ex: $ destroy BaseModel)
If the instance of the class name doesn’t exist for the id, print ** no instance found ** (ex: $ destroy BaseModel 121212)
all: Prints all string representation of all instances based or not on the class name. Ex: $ all BaseModel or $ all.
The printed result must be a list of strings (like the example below)
If the class name doesn’t exist, print ** class doesn't exist ** (ex: $ all MyModel)
update: Updates an instance based on the class name and id by adding or updating attribute (save the change into the JSON file). Ex: $ update BaseModel 1234-1234-1234 email "aibnb@mail.com".
Usage: update <class name> <id> <attribute name> "<attribute value>"
Only one attribute can be updated at the time
You can assume the attribute name is valid (exists for this model)
The attribute value must be casted to the attribute type
If the class name is missing, print ** class name missing ** (ex: $ update)
If the class name doesn’t exist, print ** class doesn't exist ** (ex: $ update MyModel)
If the id is missing, print ** instance id missing ** (ex: $ update BaseModel)
If the instance of the class name doesn’t exist for the id, print ** no instance found ** (ex: $ update BaseModel 121212)
If the attribute name is missing, print ** attribute name missing ** (ex: $ update BaseModel existing-id)
If the value for the attribute name doesn’t exist, print ** value missing ** (ex: $ update BaseModel existing-id first_name)
All other arguments should not be used (Ex: $ update BaseModel 1234-1234-1234 email "aibnb@mail.com" first_name "Betty" = $ update BaseModel 1234-1234-1234 email "aibnb@mail.com")
id, created_at and updated_at cant’ be updated. You can assume they won’t be passed in the update command
Only “simple” arguments can be updated: string, integer and float. You can assume nobody will try to update list of ids or datetime
Let’s add some rules:

You can assume arguments are always in the right order
Each arguments are separated by a space
A string argument with a space must be between double quote
The error management starts from the first argument to the last one

8. First User
  Write a class User that inherits from BaseModel:

models/user.py
Public class attributes:
email: string - empty string
password: string - empty string
first_name: string - empty string
last_name: string - empty string
Update FileStorage to manage correctly serialization and deserialization of User.

Update your command interpreter (console.py) to allow show, create, destroy, update and all used with User

9. More classes!
  Write all those classes that inherit from BaseModel:

State (models/state.py):
Public class attributes:
name: string - empty string
City (models/city.py):
Public class attributes:
state_id: string - empty string: it will be the State.id
name: string - empty string
Amenity (models/amenity.py):
Public class attributes:
name: string - empty string
Place (models/place.py):
Public class attributes:
city_id: string - empty string: it will be the City.id
user_id: string - empty string: it will be the User.id
name: string - empty string
description: string - empty string
number_rooms: integer - 0
number_bathrooms: integer - 0
max_guest: integer - 0
price_by_night: integer - 0
latitude: float - 0.0
longitude: float - 0.0
amenity_ids: list of string - empty list: it will be the list of Amenity.id later
Review (models/review.py):
Public class attributes:
place_id: string - empty string: it will be the Place.id
user_id: string - empty string: it will be the User.id
text: string - empty string

10. Console 1.0
  Update FileStorage to manage correctly serialization and deserialization of all our new classes: Place, State, City, Amenity and Review

Update your command interpreter (console.py) to allow those actions: show, create, destroy, update and all with all classes created previously.

Enjoy your first console!

No unittests needed for the console

11. All instances by class name
  Update your command interpreter (console.py) to retrieve all instances of a class by using: <class name>.all()

12. Count instances
  Update your command interpreter (console.py) to retrieve the number of instances of a class: <class name>.count().

13. Show
  Update your command interpreter (console.py) to retrieve an instance based on its ID: <class name>.show(<id>).

Errors management must be the same as previously.

14. Destroy
  Update your command interpreter (console.py) to destroy an instance based on his ID: <class name>.destroy(<id>).

Errors management must be the same as previously.

15. Update
  Update your command interpreter (console.py) to update an instance based on his ID: <class name>.update(<id>, <attribute name>, <attribute value>).

Errors management must be the same as previously.

16. Update from dictionary
  Update your command interpreter (console.py) to update an instance based on his ID with a dictionary: <class name>.update(<id>, <dictionary representation>).

Errors management must be the same as previously.

17. Unittests for the Console!
  Write all unittests for console.py, all features!

For testing the console, you should “intercept” STDOUT of it, we highly recommend you to use:Otherwise, you will have to re-write the console by replacing precmd by default.

Well done on completing this project! Let the world hear about this milestone achieved.
